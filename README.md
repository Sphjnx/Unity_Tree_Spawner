## Tree Spawner

-You have spawn button on your Inspector, after adjusting your settings, push the button and trees will spawn before game starts

-In the previous versions trees were erased when the game closed, but in newer version it stays, works kinda like Paint Trees tool of Unity's terrain tool.

-This version directly creates new objects as clones, it's kinda planting :).


## How to install

-Place OliveTreeSpawner in your Assets folder, create and empty object and assign this script as new script.

-Place OliveTreeSpawnerEditor in your Assets/Editor folder (if you don't have create one), and it's gonna link directly.
